# riot_deathrecap

This is a for-fun project using the riot games api to visualize damage done that contributed to deaths.

1. Get the match id from https://www.leagueofgraphs.com/match/na/4764831104 searching up your recent games. Copy paste it from the end of the URL, formatting like NA1_4764831104. Hit submit. Alternatively hit copy match id button from the post game lobby.
2. Click on the bars to switch between physical/magic/true breakdown and aa/q/w/e/r/other breakdown (NPC breaks down tower/minion/monster)
3. Hover over bars to get actual number or what riot classified the damage as if it was other
4. Click on specific deaths in the timeline on the bottom to just highlight that one (click it again to go back to a sum of all deaths)
5. Or drag the left white bar and right white bar on the timeline to highlight a section of deaths which is nice for looking at single teamfights or early/mid/late game
6. Click the icon of each champ to go into a view to see only them (who they were killing and who they were being killed by)
